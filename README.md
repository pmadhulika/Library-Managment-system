# Library-Managment-system
The Library Management System automates daily library operations, featuring user and teacher logins, along with an admin login for system oversight. It includes an online notice board for posting seminar details, a student portal to request new books, and a feature to view issued books with return dates. The librarian, using the admin account, can generate reports such as student, issue, and book reports. This system enhances efficiency while reducing manual effort for library staff and students.The library's books are each identified by a different number. By providing the book ID and user information, the user issues the book. One book can only be issued by a user at a time. When a user returns a book that has been issued, the book is once again accessible for loan from the library.
